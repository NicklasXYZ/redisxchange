# RedisXchange

**Note:** This library is a work in progress.

Just a few Python convenience/wrapper methods and classes for setting up FIFO message queues and/or pub-sub message brokers for clients to use for exchanging messages through [Redis](https://redis.io/). The convenience/wrapper methods and classes are built on top of [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/) and [msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-python).

## Usage

Install the library through pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/nicklasxyz/redisxchange
```
